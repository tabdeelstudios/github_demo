	<h3>What is blog writing?</h3>
	<p>The word which has gained a considerable importance in the present world of the internet is nothing else but BLOGGING. However, it has still not been able to reach out to the mass who are into daily writing because the people think anything that goes online requires much more proficiency than the handwritten manuscripts. The main obstruction has been nothing but fear.</p>
	<p>The word blog is actually a shortened form of its original name, <b>‘weblog’</b>. these allowed the early internet users to write the details of their day in diary style entries. The blogs often allow readers to comment, so as to grow a community and also to share their point of views with a greater audience.</p>
	<p>Blogging is actually writing, photography and other media that is self published on online platforms. It is in other words a way of expression in diary style that goes online.</p>

	<hr>
	<p><strong>Things to remember while blogging :</strong></p>
	<ol>
		<li>Frequent updates</li>
		<li>Informal language</li>
		<li>Engaging topics</li>
		<li>Scope for the audience to share their point of views</li>
	</ol>

	<hr>

	<h3>Exercise :</h3>
	<p>Read a blog post from your favourite blogger’s website. Rewrite the blog post in your own words. Your goal is to cut around 20% of your total word count without changing the meaning or deleting a point.Focus on shortening each paragraph itself. Cut flabby words and adverbs, remove redundancy, merge sentences, and replace long-winded phrases with shorter alternatives. You won’t be able to do it for each one, but try.</p>

	<h3>Coming up with the perfect post idea</h3>

	<p>We all want to write and many of us are pretty good at that. However, the main point here is to understand how to write a blog which would attract maximum readers. Just writing down your thoughts in correct English or any other language will not fetch the number of audience you need for your article to be read.</p>

	<p>Brainstorming is a great way to find a topic for your writing. It also gives information that will help in finding evidence for the blog. A simple definition of brainstorming is to list as many things as you can for a set period of time. This list can be used in selecting a topic. The next step is brainstorming ideas from this topic.</p>

	<ul>
		<li><p>The first step to brainstorming is selecting a time to write down topics for your blog.</p></li>
		<li><p>Begin with a few seconds of reflection as ideas begin to come to mind.</p></li>
		<li><p>Write down any ideas even if they may seem silly.</p></li>
		<li><p>Build on ideas as you begin to list them. Write down everything you can think about during this time.</p></li>
	</ul>

	<p>After the brainstorming session you will probably have a few topics written down already. Ask questions to determine the topic that you would enjoy writing more than others.</p>

	<ul>
		<li><p>Why does this topic interest me?</p></li>
		<li><p>What do I personally know about the topic? </p></li>
		<li><p>Do I know sources to use about the topic? </p></li>
		<li><p>Where can I find key information about the topic?</p></li>
	</ul>

	<p>Once you brainstorm for a topic and select one that is interesting the next step is brainstorming for specific ideas about the topic. Begin by defining the topic. Write down as many ideas and facts that you personally know about the topic.Carefully look at the topics and solutions you have listed. Use some of these solutions to make a thesis for the essay. What ideas can be used for supporting evidence? Make a careful evaluation of all the ideas and solutions listed.Keep a record of all the ideas you listed on the topic so you can refer back to these later during the essay writing process.</p>

	<h3>Writing a crisp blog post</h3>

	<p>Concise writing means using the fewest possible words to convey a clear idea. Reading too big sentences ornamented with heavy words can feel overwhelming, confusing or boring. Here are some tips to help you identify the extra words weighing down your writing and can make your writing crispier.</p>

	<ul>
		<li><p>Eliminate redundant words: They take up unnecessary space and can distract your reader. Getting rid of them simplifies the sentence. E.g <b>In my opinion, I think that’s a problem</b> can be written as <b>In my opinion, that’s a problem</b>.</p></li>
		<li><p>Strong adjectives: Using strong adjectives helps to trim down sentences and make your writing vibrant! E.g <b>Brunch was very good</b> can be written as <b>Brunch was superb</b>.</p></li>
		<li><p>Remove vague nouns: Do all the nouns actually require to be placed? Eliminating these helps to make writing more direct. E.g <b>I’m interested in the areas of History and Geography</b> can be written as <b>I am interested in History and Geography</b>.</p></li>
		<li><p>Use active sentences: Active voice sets a stronger and more direct tone. It also tends to be more concise.</p></li>
	</ul>
</div>

	<h3>Outlining your blog post</h3>

	<p>Have you ever listened to anyone telling a story and wondering when that person would come to the point because you feel bored? Then you know what it’s like to read an article that lacks organization. It’s as if you get to one point and then switch to another and  then suddenly get back to the previous point again because something suddenly hit your mind. Here are some points you may find helpful to structure the outline.</p>

	<ul>
		<li><p><b>Do some pre-reading</b>: Find out what others have written about the same topic that you’ve chosen. The easiest way to find an angle is to look for knowledge gaps.</p></li>
		<li><p><b>Objective</b> : All writers write to deliver some knowledge to the readers. Write down what you aim to convey to the readers and what the readers must take away with them. Everything you write must support your objective.</p></li>
		<li><p><b>Listing</b> : Make a list of all main points you must include your article and dont forget to write about them.</p></li>

	<h3>Creating a strong hook</h3>

	<iframe src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/615690301?h=24b14cdee2" width="640" height="1138" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; fullscreen; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>

	<p>Here's a checklist for creating a strong hook in your blog post :</p>
	<ul>
		<li>The <b>first paragraph</b> needs to have a hook. The goal of an opening paragraph should be to get the reader interested in the essay. Give them a feeling of "Wow! I did not know that!" Statistics, questions, anecdotes, striking statements, proverbs, illustrations, lines from a poem or song, and examples are all great ways to start a opening paragraph. Anecdotes are personal stories that entice the reader to want to know more about the topic. Quotations are often great ways to begin any essay. The key is using something that grabs the reader and keeps him/her reading the essay.</li>
		<li>The <b>middle portion</b> must be engaging and informative. This should lead you to your thesis statement, which is the sentence that states the main focus of the entire blog. The middle exists to support and explain the thesis using examples and evidence found through research.</li>
		<li>The <b>conclusion</b> should give the reader a sense of closure as it summarizes what has been discussed in the body of the essay. It requires giving the reader something to take away with him/her. Give an emphasis of why you have written the blog and why it was important. Sometimes asking a question in the conclusion leaves the reader with something more to ponder.</li>
	</ul>

	<ul>
		<li><p><b>Do some pre-reading</b>: Find out what others have written about the same topic that you’ve chosen. The easiest way to find an angle is to look for knowledge gaps.</p></li>
		<li><p><b>Objective</b> : All writers write to deliver some knowledge to the readers. Write down what you aim to convey to the readers and what the readers must take away with them. Everything you write must support your objective.</p></li>
		<li><p><b>Listing</b> : Make a list of all main points you must include your article and dont forget to write about them.</p></li>
	</ul>
</div>


<div style="padding:20px; font-size:18px;">
	<h3>Editing and Proofreading</h3>

	<p>Proofreading the essay is vital in having a successful blog that will please the reader.</p>
	<ul>
		<li><p>Carefully check for grammar and other errors.</p></li>
		<li><p>Change any passive sentences to active sentences.</p></li>
		<li><p>Do you have any needless words? Delete these because they often subtract from the importance of the essay.</p></li>
		<li><p>Check for the use of correct tense in the blog.</p></li>
		<li><p>Check the punctuation of your essay.</p></li>
		<li><p>Running a spell check on the essay is important but it requires a careful reading for misspelled words or inaccurate words.</p></li>
	</ul>

	<h3>How to make a living?</h3>

	<p>The main objective behind writing a blog post  is to get established in that field and earn money. However, very few of us actually know the right ways to monetize our blog. Let us know what they are: </p>
	<ul>
		<li>
			<p><b>Affiliate marketing</b>: it means including a link in your blog to a product or service. when someone clicks the link on your site, goes to the affiliate’s site and proceeds to buy the product you’ve endorsed, you earn a commission on the sale.</p>
		</li>
		<li>
			<p><b>Product selling</b>: many bloggers create an online store, and start selling products. For example, the blogger who writes on lifestyle and healthy living can sell self designed t-shirts or daily journals. It can be either physical or digital.</p>
		</li>
		<li>
			<p><b>Subscriptions</b>: If your blog has an active community that’s eager to know more about your subject, a paid membership or subscription model is another way to use your valuable content to generate revenue over the long run. You'll often find people asking you to subscribe to their channel or their blog post. That's because they earn from that.</p>
		</li>
		<li>
			<p><b>Coaching and courses</b>: Develop intuitive and helpful courses that add a tremendous amount of value. Whether you set yourself up as a life coach, a career coach or a business development coach, you can earn a significant income through just a handful of clients.When you create self-guided teaching materials such as videos or downloadable ebooks, you allow members of your audience to proceed at their own pace. As people progress through your course, you can gauge their interest about other topics to cover.</p>

	<h3>Lesson 4 : Different Structures</h3>
	<p>In this lesson, we're going to learn what structure is and how by understanding structure, you can learn how to sequence the events in your plot to help maximize your own writing abilities. All stories are organized around a basic structure. Watch the video posted below to learn more.</p>
	<p>Together we're going to learn what is plot, how is plot different from a story, how does plot shape a narrative, what makes a strong plot. We're also going to be talking about story structure, how to show instead of tell by writing scenes, how to edit and revise our work once we've finished our draft of it.</p>

	<h4>What's the difference between a story and a plot?</h4>
	<p><strong>The prominent English author E.M.Forster defines the difference like this : <em>“The king died And then the queen died” is a story. While “the king died and the queen died of grief”</em></strong> is a plot. This implies a causal relationship between those two events. in the first description First X happened and Y happened. There's no relationship between those two actions. It's like an itinerary of events that happened according to a timeline, but are not related to each other. Think about the departure board in an airport. This plane leaves for Paris at 5 PM. The next plane leaves for London at 6 PM. The two flights occur at the same airport, but they are not related to each other in any way. But in the second description, first x happened and then Y happened because of X. The queen died because she was sad about the first thing that happened. Those things are connected to each other.</p>
	<p>Now let's go back to that airport departure board. Imagine that you were supposed to be on the 5 PM flight to Paris to meet a friend, but discovered they rerouted through London and were stuck there. Therefore, you took the 6 PM flight to London instead.</p>
	<p>You don't need ANDs & THENs, you need THEREFOREs. This happened, therefore, this happened.</p>
	<p>An excellent way to visualize all of this AND & THEN events happen in a story is Freytag's Pyramid.</p>

	<hr>
	<h3>Freytag's Pyramid :</h3>
	<p>Gustav Freytag was 19th century German novelist and playwright who analyzed ancient Greek and Shakespearean drama and devised a pyramid to describe how a story works.</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Exposition</li>
		<li>Inciting incident</li>

	<h3>Character + Action = Plot</h3>
	<p><strong>John Gardner, an American Novelist, once quipped, there are only two plots in all of literature :</strong></p>
	<ul>
		<li>Someone goes on a journey</li>
		<li>A stranger comes to town</li>
	</ul>
	<p>Hayao Miyazaki, one of Japan's most celebrated animators, director of Spirited Away, <strong>Howl's Moving Castle, Ponyo,</strong> and many others, said that what drives animation is the will of the characters. You don't depict fate, you depict will. In both these examples, character is an integral component. In this section, we're going to look at how character and action can work together to create an exciting plot.</p>

	<p><strong>Crafting great characters is driven by the following key questions you should ask yourself when creating a dynamic character. </strong></p>
	<ol>
		<li>What do they want? </li>
		<li>What are their weaknesses? </li>
		<li>Where are they from? </li>
		<li>Understanding this biographical information </li>
		<li>Then, there's the  emotional answer. </li>
		<li>Where are they going?</li>
		<li>What can your characters do to surprise you?</li>
	</ol>
	<p>Look for places in your story where your characters do things you didn't expect them to do, and encourage your characters by following them instead of trying to lead them. Now that you have a rough idea of what a character should look like, it's time to give that character something to do. That's where rising actions come in.</p>

	<hr>
	<h3>Writing Exercises</h3>
	<p>Write a scene of 250-350 words featuring a character with one concrete want (a table, a moose, a toothbrush, anything physical is fine!) and one weakness. Use these two features to drive the action of the plot. Set up the story where every other sentence is a rising action. To help you come up with rising actions, use one word from the following list of twelve words in each sentence that has a rising action. In other words: Write your first sentence introducing your character. Make the next sentence a rising action using one of the following twelve words. Write your third sentence, which may introduce the weakness, then write your fourth sentence with a rising action that includes one of the remaining eleven words you haven’t used. And so on.</p>
	<ul>
		<li>trick</li>
		<li>memory</li>
		<li>aboard</li>
		<li>tiger</li>
		<li>pretend</li>
		<li>carrot</li>
		<li>appliance</li>
		<li>cage</li>
		<li>rings</li>
	</ul>
	<p>You must use at least 6 of the 12 words, but you are encouraged to challenge yourself to use as many of the words as possible while still meeting the word count.</p>


	<p><strong>Once you have your character and your action, you essentially have the plot of your story.</strong></p>

	<p>Let’s head towards learning the basics of SEO and how to create an effective SEO strategy  by following Google’s algorithm guidelines and understanding the ranking factors for success.</p>
	<p>The first step to creating an SEO strategy is to understand what keywords you're going to rank for.</p>
	<h3>Discover your Keywords and Pillar Pages</h3>
	<p>The first step in the overall SEO process is to create a good pillar strategy with high-quality keywords. Very recently, an SEO industry expert, <strong>Rand Fishkin</strong>, described a new groundbreaking SEO strategy. This new strategy is called a "<em><strong>pillar page strategy</strong></em>" or "<em><strong>10x content</strong></em>" and it aims to make your content work 10 times as hard.</p>
	<p>Pillar pages are the pages on your website that you want to generate the most traffic and are often the pages that have the best analytics. That means that they could have the following KPIs :</p>
	<ul>
		<li>high traffic levels</li>
		<li>a high amount of time spent on page</li>
		<li>a low bounce rate</li>
		<li>a high click-through-rate</li>
	</ul>
	<p>It can be a long, lengthy process to create a pillar page strategy that your company <em>needs</em>, following are a 5-step guide that will help any beginner understand what pillar pages and keywords are the most effective for your company, firm, or business.</p>
	<hr>
	<h3>Step 1: Choose Your Pillar Pages</h3>
	<p>Put yourself in the shoes of your ideal client. What would you search for if you needed the products, services, or processes that your company offers?</p>
	<p>Now, think of the pages that your client base would use the most. There really isn't a limit to the number of high-impact pages that you can use here, but be careful not to go overboard. You don't want to create a pillar page strategy that is beyond your company's capacity.</p>
	<p><em><strong><u>Pro tip</u></strong></em> : If you're using your pillar page strategy in conjunction with your blogging efforts, you'll need to <strong>create topics for each pillar page that you're creating.</strong></p>
	<hr>
	<h3>Step 2: Determine Your Keywords</h3>
	<p>Evaluate the keywords that your company is using. Where does your website rank for those terms? Are your competitors ranking for keywords that you're not considering? Really do your research here. The better your keywords are, the more traffic you'll be able to receive from Google. The objective here is to gather as many keywords as you deem necessary. We'll evaluate whether or not these keywords are the ones that you should be ranking for in the next step.</p>
	<p><em><strong><u>Pro tip</u></strong></em> : If you hit a roadblock coming up with keywords, go ahead and move ahead to Step 3. Evaluating the keywords that you came up with will help you finalize them.</p>
	<hr>
	<h3>Step 3: Utilize SEO Tools</h3>
	<p>Now that you have an idea of what your keywords are, you need to confirm that your keywords are correct, and to get suggestions on additional keywords to add. There are many SEO tools out there that can help you here, and we've listed a few here.</p>
	<p><strong>Tools to create well-optimized content :</strong></p>
	<ol>
		<li><u><strong>Google Trends</strong></u><p>Is your blogpost idea a popular one? You can run the topic through Google Trends to see search volume for the different keywords and phrases you’re considering using.</p></li>
		<li><u><strong>Keyword Planner</strong></u><p>How do you frame your awesome idea into a far-reaching blogpost (that people can easily find)? Check for popular keywords. Google’s Keyword Planner lets you enter a series of keywords, and Google returns results on search volume and popularity as well as related keywords that might spark an idea for you.</p></li>
		<li><u><strong>Keywordtool.io</strong></u><p>An alternative to Google’s Keyword Planner, Keyword Tool returns up to 750 suggestions for every keyword you enter.</p><p>(For yet another keyword tool alternative, take SERP Stat for a spin.)</p></li>
		<li><u><strong>Yoast WordPress SEO plugin</strong></u><p>SEO plugins can help you fine tune your idea and blogpost into a specific keyword or phrase that will help with search results and help keep your blogpost focused. With Yoast’s plugin, you can type in the keyword that you’re after, and Yoast tells you how many different spots on the page the post appears and a nice green dot for when you’re ready to go.</p></li>
	</ol>
	<hr>
	<h3>Step 4: Check Your Rankings</h3>
	<p>While you are going through step 3, make sure you are denoting what page you're ranking on or what rank you are on the SERPS. If you see your company's URL, make a note of what rank you are. If you don't make these notes now, then you'll have no determinant of whether or not your company is growing or falling in search engine rankings.</p>
	<p>If you have gone through 50 or 100 search results and still do not see your site, just stop there and make a note of it in your spreadsheet (i.e. 50+ and 100+).</p>
	<hr>
	<h3>Step 5: Making Decisions</h3>
	<p>Now that you have done your research and have a better understanding of your keywords, it is time to evaluate which keywords are the best 3-5 keywords per pillar page. By doing this, you'll ensure your SEO strategy is far more focused. Instead of a shotgun approach with keywords, pillar pages allow you to focus more on the specific pages you're attempting to rank for.</p>
	<p>If you understand your pillar pages, your keywords, and if they've been properly researched, you'll get a head start on creating an effective SEO strategy.</p>
	<hr>
	<h3>Optimising Off-Page SEO</h3>
	<p>While optimizing your on-page SEO is pretty straightforward, it can be much more difficult to put together quality off-page SEO. Off-page SEO involves enhancing your brand’s footprint through the use of online and offline content, personal and professional relationships, and links to create an optimal experience for both prospects and search engine crawl bots. It typically leads to gradual increases in positive brand mentions, search rankings, traffic to your site, and conversions.</p>
	<p>Off-page SEO involves enhancing your brand’s footprint through the use of online and offline content, personal and professional relationships, and links to create an optimal experience for both prospects and search engine crawl bots. It typically leads to gradual increases in positive brand mentions, search rankings, traffic to your site, and conversions.</p>
	<p>Enhancing off-page SEO is accomplished by building relationships with other websites and link-building. The domain authority of the sites that are linking to you is an essential factor of your search engine rank.</p>
	<h3>Building Links</h3>
	<p>Link building, or the overall process of acquiring hyperlinks from other websites that link back to your site, is one way to enhance your off-site SEO.A single link from a major website will go much farther than all the small ones combined.                          Educational websites and newspapers will often link to authoritative websites because as they build on-page content, they prove that they are credible.</p>
	<p>Building links is nothing like it used to be. Now links must be obtained by creating original, thought-provoking content that is then shared through social profiles.                            When your content is linked by someone via Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google+, and other networks, it allows search engines to see what is credible and help you rank for specific keywords.</p>
	<h3>Black Hat Link Building</h3>
	<p>These are SEO techniques that violate the guidelines of both Google and Bing. If you use these techniques, it is highly likely that you will receive a penalty.</p>
	<p><strong>Make sure that you steer clear of :</strong></p>
	<ul>
		<li>Link schemes (any manipulation of your site or of outgoing links from your site)</li>
		<li>Advertorials or excessive guest posting</li>
		<li>Press releases with overly-optimized anchor-text</li>
	</ul>

	<h3>Rhythm in Poetry</h3>
	<p>Learning the process of rhythm is a strenuous task, there should be a different course to explain the types and elements of a rhythm. Rhyme and rhythm of a poem go hand in hand but two quick tips to be followed are given below :</p>
	<ol>
		<li>
			<h4>Count of words</h4>
			<p>The count of words in every line in a verse should be similar, two words more or less can be excused until the rhyming scheme is correct and in place.</p>
			<p><strong>Example 1 : Matam</strong><br>
Aaj phir pyar ka matam manaya maine,  (8)<br>
Ishq mein kya kya zakhm khaya maine, (7)<br>
Humne jo chaha tha woh mila hi nahi,  (8)<br>
Jab ke harr waqt mohabbat nibhaya maine.  (7)<br>
Humko toh apne hi bacche ab chod chale,  (8)<br>
Jinko jeene ka tarika bhi sikhaya maine. (7)<br>
Seene mein chupa rakha hai mohabbat ka chirag,  (8)<br>
Jaan le woh bhi jinse chupaya maine. (7)<br></p>
<p>The above given poem is not a ghazal. It is termed as paband-nazm. A form of nazm which follows a certain rhyming scheme.</p>
		</li>
		<li>
			<h4>Repetition</h4>
			<p>The most common figure of speech is repetition. Two types of repetitions are most commonly used :</p>
			<ul>
				<li>
					<p><strong>Continuous Repetition :</strong> Wam-bam, tick-tock, ping-pong, socket-pocket, lame-blame are the examples.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p><strong>Alternate Repetition :</strong> A single or group of words are repeated at the beginning or end of a line within a verse in a poem. This enhances the performance as well as readability of the poem.</p>
				</li>
			</ul>
			<p><strong>Example 1 : Tasawwur</strong><br>
Ye jism-e-nāzuk, ye narm bāheñ, hasīn gardan, suDaul baazu,<br>
shagufta chehra, salonī rañgat, ghanerā jūḌā, siyāh gesu<br>
Nashīlī aankhein, rasili chitvan, daraz palkein, mahin abru,<br>
tamām shoḳhī, tamām bijlī, tamām mastī, tamām jaadu.<br>~ Kaifi Azmi
</p>
<p><strong>Example 2 : I have a dream (speech)</strong><br>
Let freedom ring from the prodigious hilltops of New Hampshire.<br>
Let freedom ring from the mighty mountains of New York.<br>
Let freedom ring from the heightening Alleghenies of Pennsylvania<br>~ Martin Luther King Jr.</p>
		</li>

<div style="font-size:18px; padding:20px"> 	<p>The more you know about the script, the better you can interpret that script. A good understanding results in a richer performance and, thus, the best experience possible for your audience.</p> 	<p>In order to truly understand your character and present them well, you need to know the lens through which your character sees the world. How a person sees the world determines how they view themselves, what’s most important, how decisions are made, and how they relate to other people.</p> 	<p>When you make a choice as your character, such as choosing what to say, how to say it, or when to flesh out your character’s backstory, make sure you commit to the choice or otherwise it won’t come across with authenticity.</p> 	<p>Then, physically play the character in your voice and act on those choices with conviction. For people to believe you, you need to first believe in yourself and the choices you’ve made for your character.</p> 	<hr> 	<h3>Practice Reading the Voice Acting Script</h3> 	<p>Reading a script as a professional voice actor script has two sides. The first is the creative side of understanding and interpreting your character, and the second is the technical side of voice control while delivering your lines.</p> 	<p><strong>Here are the technical vocal components you have to be aware of :</strong></p> 	<ul> 		<li> 			<p><strong>Recognizing Intonation</strong></p> 			<p>Intonation is how your voice rises and falls as you speak. You can think of intonation as your voice cadence at the end of a sentence, when you ask a question, and so on. As an example, most people’s voices go up in pitch when they ask a question.</p> 			<p>Intonation can vary between cultures, and may affect how the listener receives what the speaker is saying. As a voice actor, you must be aware of these changes and ensure that your intonation doesn’t affect the style and tone of the character.</p> 		</li> 		<li> 			<p><strong>Focusing on Phrasing</strong></p> 			<p>When you focus on the phrasing, you’re able to get through sentences in a script with ease, making the most of your breath and tone.</p> 			<p>A phrase can consist of an idea or fragment of a sentence, or it can be an entire thought. While reading a script, punctuation can help you determine how each phrase should sound.</p> 		</li> 		<li> 			<p><strong>Fluctuations in Voice Overs</strong></p> 			<p>Fluctuation involves letting your voice go up and down at will. This differs from intonation because fluctuation refers to the mastery of a vocal range, while intonation refers to speaking in a certain manner, such as having your pitch increase when asking a question.</p> 			<p>For example, fluctuating your voice means that you’re able to bring your voice up or down in pitch, kind of like singing up and down a scale.</p> 			<p>If you have a wide vocal range, you can hit a wide range of tones. If your vocal range is limited to less than an octave (think of a musical scale representing one octave), you can practice to maximize your range and make it work for you.</p> 			<p>Fluctuating your voice adds interest and flair to a read. Adding colour to your reads by fluctuating your voice can greatly improve your performance, especially when doing voice overs for narrative based projects like audiobooks, or animated films.</p> 		</li> 		<li> 			<p><strong>Vocal Elasticity</strong></p> 			<p>Elasticity is the ease in which your voice fluctuates or leaps around. That’s why warming up your voice is so important. Warming up the full extent of your range provides you with confidence and the ability to experiment, play with, and shape your voice. This is a very important aspect of voicing for people who do character voice work. Keeping your voice well hydrated by drinking plenty of water also helps.</p>		</li> 		<li> 			<p><strong>Voice Acting Versatility</strong></p> 			<p>Versatility refers to the different ways you can use your voice and your ability to change how it sounds. It takes into account your vocal range, timber (relates to the tone color or tone quality of your voice), tone, enunciation, and other vocal qualities.</p> 			<p>If you can read for a variety of projects or characters, you’re a versatile voice actor. Some people, for example, are good at recording commercials and can also do animation voice acting. Although these fields may seem polar opposites, a versatile voice actor can work in very different fields of voice acting and be very successful.</p> 		</li> 	</ul> 	<br><br><br> </div>

	<h3>Writing Exercises</h3>
	<ol>
		<li>
			<p>Choose a book or film that you have recently enjoyed, or select a story from mythology. Identify the core desire, need, or ambition in at least TWO main characters in the book/film/myth. (Cinderella: Need to be loved for who she really is. Prince: Need to be loved for who he really is.) Write one paragraph to familiarize your reader with your chosen characters. Then, create a new, original character and fit that person into your story (A second, compelling woman joins the Prince and Cinderella at the ball.) Let us see all of your characters in a social situation and craft a short scene. (Cinderella, the Prince and The New Woman are all having a drink on the terrace. Cinderella thinks she has found a new friend. The Prince is jealous. The New Woman is a flirt.) Be sure to include telling details. Your scene should not exceed 200 words, and the introductory paragraph does not count towards the word count.</p>
		</li>
		<li>
			<p>Go to a public place or local spot. Observe other people’s behavior, especially odd or intriguing acts. Create a character and put them in this place. Give them two traits: a behavior you observed and a negative trait about yourself. Now, write 300-600 words describing the character in the context of the place without writing anything directly about the character. In fact, write as if the character is not even present at the place during the time you’re writing it. Try to allow the reader to discover both of the character’s traits indirectly. This assignment is about implication, about leading the reader to see the character without directly describing him/her. For example, you might describe a handbag left behind, the contents of which show your character's preferences and avoidances, longings and dislikes.</p>
		</li>
		<li>
			<p>Create a scene (200-300 words) with at least three characters. Two of these characters should have different viewpoints on the world; one should be an “insider” in the world you’re creating, and one should be an outsider. For example, you could set the scene in your country and have one person be native and one be a foreign visitor. The third character should be an eavesdropper on a conversation between the first two. Construct the story  using no more than three speech tags (a speech tag is something that identifies a speaker, like "she said" and "Kevin replied"); instead, use the setting, descriptions, and idiosyncrasies to make the speakers identifiable. Be careful, however, to avoid caricature.</p>
		</li>
		<li>
			<p>Write an active scene (a dinner, a romance, an adventure) from the first person POV of no more than 500 words. Now take the exact same scene and write it again from the omniscient POV, entirely from scratch and without looking at the first version.</p>
		</li>

<p>According to Wikipedia,</p>
	<blockquote> “Journalism is the production and distribution of reports on current events based on facts and supported with proof or evidence.”</blockquote>
	<p>But what is journalism in real life? Journalism is a form of writing that tells people about things that really happened, but that they might not have known about already.</p>

While ghostwriting was once the practice of writing content for another with their name attached to your content, today’s version of ghostwriting is much more inclusive of multiple versions of content creation. Yes, some ghostwriters still craft content for specific authors and allow that author to take credit for the piece. But ghostwriting as an industry is increasingly becoming the practice of on-demand writers crafting content for brands.</p> <p><strong>What’s a Ghostwriter?</strong></p> <p>Ghost content writing is used by almost all companies who use content to run SEO marketing campaigns or to send emails via email marketing to their clients.</p> <p><strong>Okay, so now the question is, how do you become a lucrative ghostwriter?</strong></p> <ol> 	<li>Be a Freelance Writer First</li> 	<li>Be a Freelance Editor First</li> 	<li>Learn How to Write For Someone Else</li> 	<li>Say You’re a Ghostwriter for Hire</li> </ol> </div>

	<p>According to a Forrester Research study, approximately <strong>60% of executive buyers are unsatisfied with their interaction with sellers</strong>. Today’s buyers have access to a virtually endless supply of information, and, as a result, place an unprecedented burden on sellers to demonstrate value. In order to meet this challenge and have successful sales interactions, sales reps must change the way they sell and dedicate themselves to the buyer’s success.</p>
	<p>There are three P’s today’s sellers must adopt to have successful sales interactions :</p>

<div style="font-size:18px; padding:20px"> 	<h3>What is Poetry?</h3> 	<p>It is very important to understand what poetry is? Poetry is lofty thought or impassioned feeling expressed in imaginative words. This may sound more like an Oxford dictionary definition but while talking to Dr. Sameer Kabir, a poet and professor at Nagpur University, Urdu Department, once expressed POETRY as a ‘reflection of a poet’s life’ <em>(zindagi ka aaina)</em>. It may sound dreamy but when you think of it closely it evokes thoughtfulness.</p> 	<p>Poetry is a type of literature that conveys a thought, describes a scene or tells a story in a concentrated, lyrical arrangement of words. Poems can be structured, with rhyming lines and meter, the rhythm and emphasis of a line based on syllabic beats. Poems can also be freeform, which follows no formal structure.</p> 	<p>Poetry is a type of literature that conveys a thought, describes a scene or tells a story in a concentrated, lyrical arrangement of words. Poems can be structured, with rhyming lines and meter, the rhythm and emphasis of a line based on syllabic beats. Poems can also be freeform, which follows no formal structure.</p> 	<p><strong>Note :</strong> Ranting or writing your heart-out on a paper is not considered as poetry. A rant is usually a highly emotional or even an angry monologue delivered to others concerning one's opinion(often outrage) over a particular issue. It is usually used as an emotional vent as a catharsis effect.</p>  	<hr> 	<h3>Types of Poems</h3> 	<p>Each language consists of varied types of poems, we will be learning a few major ones only.</p> 	<strong>Urdu</strong> 	<ol> 		<li> 			<h4>Ghazal</h4> 			<p>It is one of the most difficult forms of Urdu poetry because of the fact that the rules and concepts of bahar, qafiya, radeef (Same word endings), matla (Rhythmic pattern), maqta (the final couplet containing the takhallus of the poet) etc are to be followed strictly. It must have a minimum of five couplets (sher). Each verse of a Ghazal is complete in itself.</p> 			<p> 				<em>Dil-e-nadan tujhe hua kya hai<br>Aḳhir iss dard ki dawa kya hai<br>Hum hain mushtaq aur woh bezār<br>Ya ilāhi ye majra kya hai<br>Jab ki tujh bin nahīñ koi maujūd<br>Phir ye hungāma ai ḳhudā kyā hai<br>- Ghalib</em> 			</p> 		</li> 		<li> 			<h4>Nazm</h4> 			<p>It is a freestyle form of Urdu poetry with almost no size limit. Rules are normally relaxed for Nazm. It is thematic in nature. Each of the verses is interlinked.</p> 			<p> 				<em>Do saundhe saundhe se jism jis waqt<br>ek muTThī mein so rahe the<br>laboñ kī maddham taveel sargoshiyon meiñ saanseiñ ulajh gayī thiiñ<br>muñde hue sāhiloñ pe jaise kahin bohott duur<br>ThanDā sāvan baras rahā thā<br>bas ek ruuh hī jāgtī thī<br>batā tū us waqt maiñ kahāñ thaa?<br>batā tū us waqt tū kahāñ thii?<br>- Gulzar</em> 			</p> 		</li> 	</ol> 	<strong>Hindi</strong> 	<ol> 		<li> 			<h4>Hindi Ghazal</h4> 			<p>It is similar to Urdu ghazal, the only difference is usage of words from Hindi language.</p> 			<p> 				<em>maiñ jise oḌhtā bichhātā huuñ<br>vo ġhazal aap ko sunātā huuñ<br>ek jañgal hai terī āñkhoñ meñ<br>maiñ jahāñ raah bhuul jaatā huuñ<br>tū kisī rail sī guzartī hai<br>maiñ kisī pul sā thartharātā huuñ<br>har taraf e'tirāz hotā hai<br>maiñ agar raushnī meñ aatā huuñ<br>- Dushyant Kumar</em> 			</p> 		</li> 		<li> 			<h4>Mukht Kavita</h4> 			<p>It is a freestyle form of Hindi poetry with almost no size limit.</p> 			<p> 				<em>Subah ho rahi thi<br>ki ek chamatkar hua,<br>Aasha ki ek kiran ne<br>kisi bacche ki tarah<br>kamre mein jhanka,<br>kamra jagmaga utha.<br><br>Aao andar aao, mujhe uthao,<br>Shayad meri khamoshi guunj uthi thi.<br>- Kunwar Narayan</em> 			</p> 		</li> 	</ol> 	<strong>English</strong> 	<ol> 		<li> 			<h4>Sonnet</h4> 			<p>A sonnet is a 14 line poem, typically (but not exclusively) concerning the topic of love.</p> 			<p> 				<em>How do I love thee? Let me count the ways.<br>I love thee to the depth and breadth and height<br>My soul can reach, when feeling out of sight<br>For the ends of being and ideal grace.<br>I love thee to the level of every day's<br>Most quiet need, by sun and candlelight.<br>I love thee freely, as men strive for right;<br>I love thee purely, as they turn from Praise.<br>I love with a passion put to use<br>In my old griefs, and with my childhood's faith.<br>I love thee with a love I seemed to lose<br>With my lost saints, I love thee with the breath,<br>Smiles, tears, of all my life! and, if God choose,<br>I shall but love thee better after death.<br>- Elizabeth Barrett Browning</em> 			</p> 		</li> 		<li> 			<h4>Freeverse</h4> 			<p>Free verse poetry is poetry that lacks a consistent rhyme scheme, metrical pattern, or musical form.</p> 			<p> 				<em>"I dream'd in a dream I saw a city invincible to the<br>attacks of the whole rest of the earth,<br>I dream'd that was the new city of Friends,<br>Nothing was greater there than the quality of robust<br>love, it led the rest,<br>It was seen every hour in the actions of the men of that city,<br>And in all their looks and words."<br>- Walt Whitman</em> 			</p> 		</li> 		<li> 			<h4>Haiku</h4> 			<p>A haiku is a three-line poetic form originating in Japan. The first line has five syllables, the second line has seven syllables, and the third line again has five syllables.</p> 			<p> 				<em>An old pond!<br>A frog jumps in –<br>The sound of water.<br>- Matsuo Bashō</em> 			</p> 		</li> 	</ol> 	<br><br><br> </div>

		<h3><strong>Types of Podcasts</strong></h3><hr><p>Before venturing out to start your own podcast you need to figure out your niche. though podcasters experiment with a lot of formats and also suffer from decision paralysis when it comes to choosing their podcast format. But it isn’t something you need to nail perfectly the first time. For starters it is better to stick to something you can do justice to and may attract listeners. The following are different types of formats that most podcasters follow.</p><h3><strong>1. Hybrid/ Tribrid podcast</strong></h3><p><strong>‘A host-hosts’ or ‘A Host-Caller/Callers’</strong> is the format of this broadcast. Typically to talk about something that the host is curious about and knows that it would also go down well with the listeners. These hybrid/tribrid podcasts are fanatically popular since they offer consistently fresh content and diverse perspectives. It starts with a commentary or a monologue from the host about the subject and then it is turned over for a panel discussion, interview or contribution from another source. The caller or callers are usually an expert on the subject or have personal experience on the said topic.</p><p>This podcast comes with its own sets of pros and cons.</p><p><strong>Pros :</strong></p>
		<ul>
			<li>Your guests do most of the talking. You just have to steer the conversation.</li>
			<li>Listeners are forgiving about little mistakes (ums, likes, and brief pauses) because they know you’re having a legitimate conversation.</li>
			<li>Opens your show to a new audience because your guests promote their appearance on your show, especially to their fan base.</li>
			<li>Your show gains access to a variety of viewpoints and opinions, which stimulates discussion and adds value for your listener</li>
		</ul>
		<p><strong>Cons : </strong></p>
		<ul>
			<li>This is an extremely popular format, so you’ll struggle to stand out</li>
			<li>Interviewing is a skill that takes patience and practice.</li>
			<li>Finding a new guest for each episode takes a lot of work.</li>
			<li>If you interview someone over Skype or Zoom, you’re at the mercy of your connection. It may take a few tries to get enough audio for an episode.</li>
			<li>You have to do some deep research on your guests.</li>
			<li>In some sense, you rely on your guests’ ability to entertain and deliver information. Your episode will suffer if they’re difficult, inarticulate, or boring, (unless you can compensate).</li>
		</ul>
		<br>
		<hr>
		<h3><strong>2. The solo/monologue format</strong></h3>
		<p><strong>Fly Solo! This format is for the podcasters who dare to do it all alone. The episodes are based on the creator's own experience and expertise and can be based on anything from comedy- to advise based content. This format needs detailed research about the subject the podcaster will speak on. And since it is solo, it needs to hold the attention of the audience hence the script needs to be thoroughly worked on. The podcaster also needs to decide the time limit for each topic. Many new podcasters start with this format because it’s so simple. All you need to get started is a microphone and some free editing software.</strong></p>
		<p><strong>Pros : </strong></p>
		<ul>
			<li>No need to schedule recording around anyone else. Make a new episode when and where it works for you!</li>
			<li>Your audience comes to know you intimately. This is powerful for brand building. Hence you’ll build a deep personal relationship with your audience.</li>
			<li>Editing one voice is <em>much easier</em> than editing multiple tracks.</li>
			<li>If you don’t like how you said something, you can simply say it again and cut out the bad bits.</li>
		</ul>
		<p><strong>Cons : </strong></p>
		<ul>
			<li>With no one to bounce off of, you'll have to hold down the fort on your own.</li>
			<li>If you’re nervous behind the mic, you may need to practice a bit before recording for your first episode.</li>
			<li>It’s a <em>lot</em> of talking. Speaking for 30 to 45 minutes is tiring. And that’s only if you record it perfectly the first time. Realistically, you’ll talk for an hour or more for each episode.</li>
		</ul>
		<br><hr>
		<h3><strong>3. Conversational/co-hosted podcast format</strong></h3><p>This is another common podcast format. It involves two people having a straightforward conversation who generally have great chemistry together. Unlike an interview podcast format, however, these two people are both hosts. In many cases, each host will play a specific role in the conversation. One might report the news snippet while the other provides commentary or comedy. One might teach lessons while the other tells stories from their experience.</p>
		<h4>Pros :</h4>
		<ul>
			<li>You’re only responsible for half the conversation. You might also split up all the other tasks that come with producing and promoting a podcast.</li>
			<li>Fans feel like they’re part of a club or group, especially when the hosts create an entertaining, friendly environment.</li>
			<li>It’s easy to listen to an organic conversation rather than a prepared script.</li>
		</ul>
		<h4>Cons :</h4>
		<ul>
			<li>You both need to stay on the same page regarding the purpose of each episode. There could be a conflict if you don’t agree on the overall message.</li>
			<li>It’s harder to edit two voices as opposed to one track.</li>
			<li>You have to choose topics you both know about (at least a little).</li>
			<li>Since each episode relies on conversation, you can’t do much scripting to prepare.</li>
		</ul>
		<br><hr>
		<h3><strong>4. Podcast Theatre</strong></h3><p>They say everyone has atleast one good book in them, and podcast theatre is the new novel writing. If you're a fan of audiobooks or fiction stories in general, you'll love podcast theatre. These are fictional stories told across episodes like a TV show, but just audio! They feature voice actors, scripts, and just like TV shows they often have cliffhangers and intriguing plotlines that keep listeners wanting to know what's next.</p>
		<p>If you're a fiction writer or into making short films this could be a great podcast format for you to explore and use your storytelling skills in a new medium. Infact, some fiction writers simply read their stories dramatically like audio books and release them as podcast episodes.</p>
		<p><strong>Pros :</strong></p>
		<ul>
			<li>There is a less saturated market for these shows currently.</li>
			<li>Just like with non-fiction storytelling shows, these shows can be addictive!</li>
		</ul>
		<p><strong>Cons :</strong></p>
		<ul>
			<li>This format is a lot of work. You've got all the difficulty of writing a story, with the added work of producing it with voice actors!</li>
			<li>As this is a less common show format, it might be harder to get new listeners to give it a try.</li>
		</ul>
		<br><hr>
		<h3><strong>5. Repurposed content</strong></h3>
		<p>Repurposing content is when you take content that already exists and transform it in a way to get more value out of it. You might add to it, split it up, or transpose it to a new medium. Some bloggers simply take existing written content and repurpose it into a podcast for an audio experience.</p>
		<p>For instance, a religious organization may turn their weekly sermon into a downloadable podcast. A speaker could record and release his lectures. A comedian might publish recordings from his standup routines</p>
		<h4>Pros :</h4>
		<ul>
			<li>Easy to produce this content because you already have it. You just have to do some editing to format it like a podcast.</li>
			<li>Since you don’t have to make the content, you don’t need a big budget.</li>
		</ul>
		<h4>Cons :</h4>
		<ul>
			<li>Since the content wasn’t originally intended for a podcast, it might not feel <em>quite right.</em> For instance, a lecturer might ask his audience for a “show of hands,” which obviously isn’t interactive through a podcast.</li>
			<li>People have other ways of getting the exact same content.</li>
		</ul>
		<br><hr>
		<h3><strong>6. Educational shows</strong></h3>
		<p>Educational shows often have multiple hosts but are more structured than a conversational podcast. The episodes will feature a specific lesson or takeaway, and listeners will tune in ready to learn about the topic at hand. Mariah Coz and Megan Minns of The Femtrepreneur Show, for example, produce new episodes every week teaching people how to create, run, and sell online courses.</p>
		<p>Learning by listening to a podcast is great because you can do it while commuting, doing the dishes, walking the dog– they turn downtime into productive time! And producing an educational show will often mean creating evergreen content that can be consumed for years to come.</p>
		<h4>Pros :</h4>
		<ul>
			<li>High-value information will keep your audience coming back for more.</li>
			<li>It's easy to create supplemental content like PDF downloads, videos, or even full courses to get your audience involved on multiple levels.</li>
		</ul>
		<h4>Cons :</h4>
		<ul>
			<li>Some topics can be hard to teach without supporting visuals. You can direct listeners to your site for show notes, but overall your lesson should be easy to grasp through audio only.</li>
		</ul>

	<h3><strong>Podcasting and Promoting</strong></h3>
	<hr>
	<p>After having all your equipment in place, next thing you need to focus on is the matter of your podcast. I cannot begin to emphasize enough all the things that can go wrong if you don’t have a written script for your podcast. It may take you days to create content for your shows, take them! But don’t think that your outlines are enough to get you through. Have atleast five scripts ready and choose the best three and record them. For the starters you atleast need more than one podcast to go on air.</p>
	<p>When you write a podcast script you need to have a bird’s eye view of your show. To begin with, make an outline for your show. Here is an example:</p>
	<p>1. Introduction.</p>
	<p>2. Musical jingle/sound effects</p>
	<p>3. Longer explanation of what’s in store<</p>
	<br>
	<p>1. Topic 1</p>
	<ol>
		<li>Main point</li>
		<li>Supporting point</li>
		<li>Supporting data</li>
		<li>Supporting quote</li>
	</ol>
	<p>2. Segue</p>
	<p>3. Topic 2</p>
	<ol>
		<li>Main point</li>
		<li>Supporting point</li>
		<li>Supporting data</li>
		<li>Supporting quote</li>
	</ol>
	<p>4.Topic 3</p>
	<ol>
		<li>Main point</li>
		<li>Supporting point</li>
		<li>Supporting data</li>
		<li>Supporting quote</li>
	</ol>
	<p>5. Segue</p>
	<p>6. Outro</p>
	<p>7. Call to action</p>
	<p>8. Sponsor message</p>
	<p>9. Musical jingle/sound effects.</p>
	<p><strong>Your podcast script need not mirror the same outline. Customize it to fit the needs of your show. And in case you have a guest on your show, replace each topic with a question for your guest.</strong></p>
	<p>Now that your outline is ready, fill in every little detail about what you will speak about and what things you want to give voice to. <strong>And while scripting for your podcasts you need to consider following points:</strong></p>
	<ol>
		<li><strong><em>What is the overarching purpose of my show?</em></strong></li>
		<li><strong><em>Who is my target audience?</em></strong></li>
		<li><strong><em>What kind of content will resonate with my target audience?</em></strong></li>
		<li><strong><em>How often will I release a new episode?</em></strong></li>
	</ol>
	<p><strong>Script tips for Beginners</strong>
	 : Talking intelligently, smoothly, and clearly is challenging without practice. During the recording, you can focus on your mechanics, like enunciating, removing filler words, and controlling your tone and volume. Over time, you’ll be able to reduce your podcast script to a simple outline with notes.</p>
	 <p><strong><u>Here are a few tips that will help you craft an engaging podcast script :</u></strong></p>
	 <h3><strong>1. Keep it conversational</strong></h3>
	 <p>The biggest challenge of writing a podcast script is keeping it conversational. If you aren’t careful, reading a podcast script can lead to a flat, monotone delivery. A lot of podcasters find it useful to speak their script (like a rehearsal for their recording) with a speech-to-text tool open to dictate their words. This creates a natural pattern and puts your words on a page so you can read them during your recording. Just make sure to give it an edit to smooth out rough patches and include all your information. Google Docs has a free tool that comes in handy here. You can even use this as your podcast transcript.</p>
	 <h3><strong>2. Use delivery notes</strong></h3>
	 <p>Another trick every good podcast script includes are delivery notes. These are notes within your script that indicate pauses, emphasis, laughs, sighs, and other dramatic effects. These elements breathe life into your podcast script so it feels natural. Make sure to read your podcast script aloud with your delivery notes so they sound genuine.</p>

	 <h3><strong>3. Allow for some riffing</strong></h3>
	 <p>Just because you write a podcast script before your recording doesn’t mean you are bound to it. It’s quite alright to go off script during your recording if you think of something important or valuable on the spot. If you decide you don’t like it, you can always edit it out later.</p>
	 <p>That said, be mindful about going off on irrelevant tangents. If you add a bunch of fluff content to your recording, you’re just a waste of time in front of the microphone and you’re editing software later.</p>
	 <h3><strong>4. Describe the scene</strong></h3>
	 <p>Podcasting is an audio medium, which means our audience doesn’t have any visual cues. If you refer to something, like an image, person, or video, make sure to describe it well so your listeners can picture it in their mind. Your descriptions should be detailed and vibrant.It sounds easy, but this is a hard skill to master. You may find it is odd to speak to people who aren’t in the room who can’t see what you see. It may help to think of recording a podcast like talking to someone on the phone. This doesn’t mean you need to give a detailed description of <em>everything</em> you say, but you’ll want to be aware of any concepts, images, or topics that need extra description for your listeners who are effectively blind.</p>
	 <h3><strong>5. Maintain a reasonable pace</strong></h3>
	 <p>The best podcast episodes maintain a consistent space that keeps listeners engaged. A good pace is not too fast and not too slow. There shouldn’t be any long, unexplained pauses. And there shouldn’t be any moments where you talk too fast to be understood. Use segments and transitions to keep your podcast script organized and help listeners understand where they are in your episode. For instance, you might divide your episode into chapters with their own titles, or turn your lessons into numbered steps or tips. Write transition phrases into your podcast script to move between segments. For example, you might say, “Now that you understand the importance of user data, let’s talk about the tools you need to collect it.”</p>
	 <h3><strong>6. Be yourself</strong></h3>
	 <p>You are a unique person with your own personality. It’s much easier and more natural to be yourself than to try to be someone else, even if that someone else is a successful podcast. While it’s useful to take lessons from the pros, don’t try to mimic them. Write a podcast script that serves your needs and shows off your personality</p>
	 <h3><strong>7. Preparation Is Key</strong></h3>
	 <p>Preparation is a critical part of producing high quality podcast episodes. Writing a podcast script is a key way to ensure your audio is clear, tight, and valuable for your listeners. You don’t have to write out every word you intend to say, but it’s important to have notes for each episode to keep you on track, especially if you’re new to podcasting.</span></p>

	<h3><strong>Podcast on the floor</strong></h3>
	<hr>
	<p>Now that your dish is prepared, it is time for you to serve it. Word of mouth will do wonders for you, and hence tag in your family and friends to promote you. Use your social media handles to spread the word. But again the question is where you will serve it ? I recommend serving your dish to multiple vendors, and not just one. We have a list of vendors for you to consider.</p>
	<h3><strong>1. Apple Podcasts</strong></h3>
	<p>The biggest of the bunch and the one with arguably the largest share of listeners across Mac and iOS devices, Apple has been a major player in the distribution game since 2005 and is showing no signs of slowing. Apple recently rebranded the podcast wing of iTunes as, simply, <em>Apple Podcasts</em> and submitting your podcast to its directory couldn’t be simpler.</p>
	<ol>
		<li>Head to <em>podcastsconnect.apple.com</em> and log in with your Apple ID, or create one if you haven’t already.</li>
		<li>Hit the big ➕ button in the top left corner, enter your podcasts’ RSS feed, and then “Verify”.</li>
		<li>As long as your feed is valid you should see your podcast’s details like artwork, categories, host etc</li>
		<li>Press the “Submit” button and you’re all done.</li>
		<li>Wait up for email confirmation from Apple that your show has been accepted into the directory.</li>
	</ol>
	<p><strong>Apple Podcasts will give you access to a large portion of podcast listeners and its directory is used by some popular apps like Overcast and Pocket Casts so it's important that your show is here.</strong></p>
	<h3><strong>2. Stitcher</strong></h3>
	<p>One of the most popular alternatives to the default Apple podcast app according to Nick Quah and rightly so. It’s been the go-to podcast app for Android users in lieu of Google’s absence until recently. To opt-in to Stitcher you register as a Content Provider also known as a Partner.</span></p>
	<img src="https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/unboxingartbydrp.appspot.com/o/course_images%2Fpodcasting_8.png?alt=media&token=ab7b6f33-6cb9-479d-a25d-ab14d816c2e5">
	<ol>
		<li>Create a Content Provider profile here</li>
		<li>Once you’re logged in to your newly created account click the “Add Show” button</li>

	</ol>
	<p>Stitcher offers its own analytics portal within your account which can be great for seeing how your episodes are doing on the platform.</p>
	<h3><strong>3. TuneIn</strong></h3>
	<p>Do you own an Amazon Echo or one of the other Alexa enabled devices to listen to podcasts? Well if you do then Alexa is getting those podcasts from TuneIn.Submitting to TuneIn is a really straightforward process too And before you know it you can be asking Alexa to play your podcast.</p>
	<ol>
		<li>Go to TuneIn’s podcast submission page</li>
		<li>Fill in the required feed details</li>
		<li>Wait for approval</li>
	</ol>
	<h3><strong>4. Submit your podcast to Spotify</strong></h3>
	<p>Submit your podcast to Spotify, a music, podcast and video streaming service with over 140 million users. Use the exclusive Blubrry form to expedite your submission.</p>
	<p><strong>Get others talking!</strong><br>Positive reviews about your podcast go a long way. We recommend you routinely ask your audience in every episode to leave a review on your listing on iTunes. Each review helps push your podcast further up in iTunes ranking. In addition, when someone blogs about your podcast, the web traffic to your site also gets a positive uptick. It’s a win-win!</p>

	<h3><strong>Ingredients for your podcast</strong></h3>
	<hr>
	<p>Having covered a few podcast formats we will now delve into the technical part of it. Recording your podcast is secondary, to get to the recording part with the right equipment is the goal. This chapter will cover all the basic ingredients needed for you to start a podcast. Though you are someone only trying to have your message out there and though we would not recommend you to burn a HOLE IN YOUR HEART but a hole in your pocket is recommended.</p>
	<p>The term podcast equipment term covers such a wide variety of gear, though. It's easy to imagine a pro-level radio studio filled with lots of intimidating (and very expensive) equipment. But for the vast majority of podcasters, that looks nothing like their own recording setup.</p>
	<p>You can break podcast equipment down into categories, based on how you record and capture your voice, from mic to mixer to recorder to computer.</p>
	<p>The recording process that can be made as simple or as complicated as you like. You can record right into your computer, ridding yourself of the need for a mixer or a recorder. Or you can go the full studio route, and use all four.</p>
	<p><strong><u>Here’s a quick to the point things you need to know about podcast accessories:</u></strong></p>
	<p><strong>A Microphone:</strong> Well this is the main ingredient in your recipe of podcasting. What’s the point if you have a script ready and you don’t have a proper Mic? According to peakgeek they say there are various terms you need to consider before choosing a Mic.</p>
	<p><strong>Dynamic and Condenser:</strong> Dynamic microphones is the oldest type of microphone available. They are cheaper than condenser microphones and can handle louder voices. They capture sound in front of the microphone and are used for live performances and musical instruments.</p>
	<p>Condenser microphones capture sound surrounding the microphone and therefore, is best when used in a studio setting where background noise can be controlled. They are more expensive than dynamic microphones and also require electricity to run them (aka phantom power).</p>
	<p><strong>Phantom Power:</strong> This is the term given to processing power (direct current) to microphones which require electric power. Condenser microphones require Phantom Power whereas Dynamic microphones do not.</p>
	<p><strong>XLR and USB:</strong> These are the two types of cable systems. USB mics are mics which connect directly to a laptop or a computer.</p>
	<p>XLR mics need a mixer to connect to the computer.</p>
	<p>XLR mics offer superior sound and quality over USB microphones but are generally more expensive to set up since you need a mixer and XLR cables to get recording</p>
	<p><strong><u>How to choose a podcast Mic?</u></strong></p>
	<p><strong>Sound Quality:</strong> Typically podcasters choose a dynamic microphone in a normal room to reduce ambience sounds and room echo. This is similar to mics used by radio presenters.</p>
	<p><strong>Your Budget/Cost:</strong> Podcast mics quality and price go hand-in-hand. The more the price, the higher the quality you get. In India, microphones are expensive when compared to other countries as most mics are imported in India, so custom duties add up and hence, the price.</p>
	<p><strong>Design:</strong> Do you want to have a mic which stands on a desk? Or do you want one which suspends on a stand? Choose mics which suit your way of use and you won’t regret it.</p>
	<p><strong>Type of Mic:</strong> There are two types of mics: Condenser and Dynamic.</p>
	<p>Without getting too technical, we would suggest getting a Dynamic microphone if you are recording in a normal room that is, not a controlled environment – like a studio.</p>
	<p>If you are operating in a studio where you can control the background noise, we would suggest using a condenser microphone.</p>

	<p>You get a 1/4″ cable included and a one-year warranty. A solid choice for a podcast mic under Rs. 2000.</p>
	<h3><strong>3. Shure SM57-LC Cardioid Dynamic Microphone</strong></h3>

	<h2><strong>Best Condenser Microphones</strong></h2>
	<h3><strong>1. Maono AU-A03 Condenser Microphone Kit Podcast Mic with Boom Arm Microphone Stand</strong></h3>
	<img src="https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/unboxingartbydrp.appspot.com/o/course_images%2Fpodcasting_5.png?alt=media&token=0d20660e-e411-488e-968f-385c8bd6db30">
	<p>This is a great starter-pack for YouTubers.

	<h3><strong>2. Boya BYM1 Omnidirectional Lavalier – The Best Condenser Microphone under Rs. 1000 in India :</strong></h3>
	<img src="https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/unboxingartbydrp.appspot.com/o/course_images%2Fpodcasting_6.png?alt=media&token=b2a2296c-eb9b-4b65-b886-38904ae5d196">
	<p>This is the perfect plug-and-play mic for beginners. It comes with a 20 ft audio cable with a 3.5 mm jack. It also has a clip which you can use to hold the mic.</p>
	<p>A big mistake people will make with this mic is to use it outside, but since this is a condenser microphone, it will capture a lot of background noise and you will have to work at reducing that a lot.</p>
	<p>But for under Rs. 1000, this is the best mic to start with. You can directly plugin to your smartphone, DSLR camera or laptop and start recording. No fuss whatsoever. It is small and discreet and will work great in quiet settings.</p>
	<br><hr>
	<h3><strong>Digital Recorders</strong></h3>
	<p>If you think you'll be recording a podcast with other people in-person, though, that's when a <a href="https://www.thepodcasthost.com/equipment/best-digital-podcast-recorders/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><strong>digital recorder</strong></a> comes in handy. The reason being, it's hard to record with more than one USB mic into a single computer.</p>
	<p>In this case, the idea setup is one digital recorder and two (or more!) XLR microphones. We recommend a <a href="https://www.thepodcasthost.com/equipment/zoom-h5-review-for-podcasting/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><strong>Zoom H5</strong></a> and two <a href="https://www.thepodcasthost.com/equipment/samson-q2u-podcasting-review/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><strong>SamsonQ2Us</strong></a> for this.</p>
	<br><hr>
	<h3><strong>Recording into a Smartphone</strong></h3>
	<p>For solo recording or a two-person interview, an option we really like the Rode Smartlav+. This is a lavalier mic (tie mic or lapel mic – those wee ones you see clipped to a shirt!) and it plugs right into your smartphone.</p>
	<p>If you add a Rode SC6 adapter to this setup, then you can plug in two Smartlavs, and record an interview with someone right next to you! See the whole <a href="https://www.thepodcasthost.com/equipment/recording-podcast-interviews-with-smartphone-rode-sc6/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" ><strong>Smartlav interview setup</strong></a> here if you think this'll suit you.</p>
	<br><hr>
	<h2><strong>What Software Do I Need to Record a Podcast?</strong></h2>
	<p>After having your Mic in place, the next thing you need is a software to record your podcast. And since your set up is not an actual studio but your home, and you’re not using a digital recorder, you need a software for recording not just editing but recording as well.</p>
	<p><strong><u>Recording solo in your computer</u></strong></p>
	<p>Let's take the simplest option first: recording a podcast on your own.</p>
	<p>If you're flying solo, then the easiest choice is to record right into an editing package, like Audacity, or Audition. Audacity is the first choice for many, for one very good reason:<strong> it's free!</strong></p>
	<p>There are a few good reasons to pay for Audition, or one of the other paid editing packages. But, if you're just starting, there's no risk in trying out Audacity first. It's really simple for recording.</p>
	<p>One final choice here, if you're looking to tie recording into the wider process, is <strong>Alitu: the Podcast maker</strong>. Alitu is designed to take care of the tech in creating your podcast, and recording is one part of that.</p>
	<p>Right now, you can record solo right into the web app. The advice is to keep it short – under 10 minutes – as browser recording can be unreliable. So, it's perfect for intros, outros, adverts, and the like. But, it's possible to go longer, with a workaround. If you normally do a 30 minute show, you can always hit stop at natural break, around the 10 minute mark. Then, hit record again, and continue. Alitu's episode builder will allow you to easily piece all 3 together without a problem.</p>
	<p>The team is currently working on browser backup, so in the near future you'll be able to record an hour or more, no problem, but for now, this can work. As a bonus, it'll polish up your audio, add your music, piece together all the clips (you can upload your other recordings too, such as an interview), and publish your final file.</p>
	<p>It makes everything super-easy, for sure. It's a subscription product, so it comes at a cost, but if you're willing to trade a monthly payment for saving a bunch of time and stress, it might be worth a go.</p>
	<p><strong><u>Recording an Online Call</u></strong></p>
	<p>If you run an interview show then there's a good chance you'll need to record your podcast online at some point, if not every week! Similar if you have a co-host and they're not local to you. There are a few options here for you.</p>
	<h4><strong><u>Recording a Podcast on Skype</u></strong></h4><p>First, you can go the traditional route: recording a Skype call. Skype is so well used that it's a good option for most folks. It's unlikely you'll find an interviewee that doesn't have a Skype account!</p>
	<p>Skype offers a tool to do it themselves, these days, which makes things nice and easy. But, it's a little limited. So, you might want to upgrade to eCamm or Talkhelper. Check out our article on <strong>recording a Skype call</strong> for all the options, and full links.</p>
	<h4><u>Zoom.us</u></h4>
	<p>A tool that we like for sheer simplicity is Zoom.us. Zoom is, at a basic level, a video conferencing tool. You set up a room, give out a web link, and anyone can sign into the call via that link. It couldn't get any simpler, since your interviewee doesn't have to have a Skype account, or any software at all.</p>
	<p>As a bonus, Zoom automatically records the call, and sends you an audio and a video file at the end. You can even set it up to record two speakers on separate channels, so you can process your interviewee separately during editing. Good for folks that love the control!</p>
	<p>Zoom is free to use if you're only recording 1 other person, and it's relatively low-cost for bigger groups.</p>
	<h4><u>Double Enders</u></h4>
	<p>The final option is one that trades a little effort, and a drop of money, for much higher quality.</p>
	<p>The term ‘double ender' refers to recording both ends of the conversation separately, directly on the speaker's computer. So, your mic is recorded on your computer, and your interviewee's mic is recorded on their computer. This bypasses the usual internet-phone issues of call-dropping and audio glitches.</p>
	<p>There are a few companies offering this as a service now, making it pretty easy to run. You'll simply set up a new call and send your interviewee a link, similar to Zoom.us. But, this time, the software will record each side independently, and stitch it all together at the end. That just leaves you to download the final result and use it in your episode. Easy!</p>
	<p><strong><u>Smartphone Recording Software</u></strong></p>
	<p>If you've decided that the Smartlav microphone might suit you, then a final option is to record a double-ender call on your Smartphone. <strong>Ringr</strong> provides a great mobile app for this, so you can record into your Phone, via a Smartlav+ mic.</span></p>
	<p>If you're doing a lot of interviews and you've decided that a double-ender tool, like <strong>Ringr</strong>, is worth the money, then a <strong >Smartlav+</strong> is a good addition to your recording arsenal. It gives you a lot of flexibility, since you can then record a good quality online interview just about anywhere.</p>

	<p><strong>Micro Tales : 23 words<br>Snippets: 50 words<br>Long Post: 1000 words</strong></p>
	<hr>
	<h3>Snippets</h3>
	<p>Exploring a wide range of snippets lets you examine the inside of your mind. Never tried to write a thriller, as you do romance, but are curious if you could? Just spend a few snippets on it. You might get the curiosity out of your system or you might find that itch to write in this domain is something you need to follow up on.</p>
	<p><strong>Here are some of the levels of focus this process can help expand and improve:</strong></p>
	<ul>
		<li><p><strong>Ideas.</strong> Just bang out as many ideas as possible and don’t worry about the wording or getting anything polished.</p></li>
		<li><p><strong>Descriptions.</strong> Work on experimenting with how you describe a scene, a character, a setting. Take chances. Stray from your comfort zone. What do you have to lose?</p></li>
		<li><p><strong>Structure.</strong> How do your ideas and thoughts hang together? Focus on the scaffolding of the scene. You don’t have to write it all out, or even finish it. You are looking at the pearls on a necklace.</p></li>
		<li><p><strong>Paragraphs.</strong> A paragraph is the smallest unit of real meaning in a book, says Stephen King, not the sentence. Focus on getting a good unified thought expressed in a tight, vibrant paragraph.</p></li>
		<li><p><strong>Sentences.</strong> Work on writing the perfect sentence. Even if you just get one done in a night, it’s huge progress.</p></li>
		<li><p><strong>Words.</strong> Just work on extracting a descriptive, fabulous vocabulary from your mind.</p></li>
		<li><p><strong>Tone and voice.</strong> Explore different characters and scenes to see if you can hit upon a unique voice that sings out in as little as a paragraph or two. This is the trick you need to pull off in the opening pages of a book. What readers (and agents and editors) are looking for in the first words is the promise of a great read, and that means distinctive voice.</p></li>
	</ul>
	<p><strong>For example: “the Subject of her Marriage had become dinner table Conversation in the Family. “What are you precisely looking for in a man?” they asked one evening. “I need Someone who has Suffered and understands Suffering” She said under her breath.”</strong></p>

	<p>Microfiction is the art of writing an in depth story in very few words, as few as 50 words or even less to fit in with Twitter. Microfiction was originally called flash fiction. Then word counts decreased further and microfiction was created. Recently it has become more popular and established itself in literature. The works usually include basic elements of creative writing that have been strictly edited and tailored to fit the word length criteria.</p>
	<p>Microfiction is written in the same format as a fiction, with a <strong>Start, Middle, and an End</strong>. The stories often contain humorous connotations or are fairly profound and tell of a moral or consequence whilst others may be sarcastic, based on horror or simply tell of the oddities of human nature or the animal world. Characters need to be attractive to the readers. And since every word written in microfiction counts, each word has to have  a purpose. And those words need to serve the purpose to the <strong>Main Noun</strong>.</p>

लफ़्ज़ काग़ज़ पे बैठते ही नहीं<br></p>
<p>कब से बैठा हुआ हूँ मैं जानम<br>
सादे काग़ज़ पे लिखके नाम तेरा<br>
बस तेरा नाम ही मुकम्मल है<br>
इससे बेहतर भी नज़्म क्या होगी<br></p><br><br>

		<h4>तआक़ुब - जावेद अख़्तर</h4>
		<p>सुब्ह से शाम हुई और हिरन मुझ को छलावे देता<br>
सारे जंगल में परेशान किए घूम रहा है अब तक<br>
उस की गर्दन के बहुत पास से गुज़रे हैं कई तीर मिरे<br>
वो भी अब उतना ही हुश्यार है जितना मैं हूँ<br>
इक झलक दे के जो गुम होता है वो पेड़ों में<br>
मैं वहाँ पहुँचूँ तो टीले पे कभी चश्मे के उस पार नज़र आता है<br>
वो नज़र रखता है मुझ पर<br>
मैं उसे आँख से ओझल नहीं होने देता<br>
कौन दौड़ाए हुए है किस को<br>
कौन अब किस का शिकारी है पता ही नहीं चलता<br>
सुब्ह उतरा था मैं जंगल में<br>
तो सोचा था कि उस शोख़ हिरन को<br>
नेज़े की नोक पे परचम की तरह तान के मैं शहर में दाख़िल हूँगा<br>
दिन मगर ढलने लगा है<br>
दिल में इक ख़ौफ़ सा अब बैठ रहा है<br>
कि बिल-आख़िर ये हिरन ही<br>
मुझे सींगों पर उठाए हुए इक ग़ार में दाख़िल होगा<br>
</p><br><br>

		<h4>पहली बार - ज़ीशान साहिल</h4>
		<p>पहली बार<br>
सितारा बनना<br>
दूसरी बार बिखर जाना<br>
पहली बार<br>
ठहर नॉवेल में<br>
दूसरी बार गुज़र जाना<br>
पहली बार<br>
उसे ख़त लिखना<br>
दूसरी बार जला देना<br>
पहली बार<br>
मोहब्बत करना<br>
दूसरी बार भुला देना<br>

		<h4>मैं जिसे ओढ़ता-बिछाता हूँ - दुष्यंत कुमार</h4>
		<p>मैं जिसे ओढ़ता-बिछाता हूँ<br>
वो ग़ज़ल आपको सुनाता हूँ<br><br>

एक जंगल है तेरी आँखों में<br>
मैं जहाँ राह भूल जाता हूँ<br><br>

तू किसी रेल-सी गुज़रती है<br>
मैं किसी पुल-सा थरथराता हूँ<br><br>

हर तरफ़ ऐतराज़ होता है<br>
मैं अगर रौशनी में आता हूँ<br><br>

एक बाज़ू उखड़ गया जबसे<br>
और ज़्यादा वज़न उठाता हूँ<br><br>

मैं तुझे भूलने की कोशिश में<br>
आज कितने क़रीब पाता हूँ<br><br>

कौन ये फ़ासला निभाएगा<br>
मैं फ़रिश्ता हूँ सच बताता हूँ<br><br>

		<h4>The Way Through the Woods - Rudyard Kipling</h4>
		<p>They shut the road through the woods<br>
Seventy years ago.<br>
Weather and rain have undone it again,<br>
And now you would never know<br>
There was once a road through the woods<br>
Before they planted the trees.<br>
It is underneath the<br>
coppice and heath,<br>
And the thin anemones.<br>
Only the keeper sees<br>
That, where the ring-dove broods,<br>
And the badgers roll at ease,<br>
There was once a road through the woods.<br>
Yet, if you enter the woods<br>
Of a summer evening late,<br>
When the night-air cools on the trout-ringed pools<br>
Where the otter whistles his mate,<br>
(They fear not men in the woods,<br>
Because they see so few.)<br>
You will hear the beat of a horse’s feet,<br>
And the swish of a skirt in the dew,<br>
Steadily cantering through<br>
The misty solitudes,<br>
As though they perfectly knew<br>
The old lost road through the woods.<br>
But there is no road through the woods.<br>
</p><br><br>

		<h4>They Went Home - Maya Angelou</h4>
		<p>They went home and told their wives,<br>
that never once in all their lives,<br>
had they known a girl like me,<br>
But... They went home.<br>
They said my house was licking clean,<br>
no word I spoke was ever mean,<br>
I had an air of mystery,<br>
But... They went home.<br>
My praises were on all men's lips,<br>
they liked my smile, my wit, my hips,<br>
they'd spend one night, or two or three.<br>
But...<br>

		<h3>(video)</h3>
		<p>Not less than 15 years ago, to reach an audience, one had to go through a hyper-selective process where one person had the power to decide if you’d be allowed to speak to the general public. Then the internet came along (for real), and suddenly anyone could put anything online. Today, curation isn’t done by any one person, but by the public who votes with their attention. This new democracy has seen a new class of citizens emerge: The Creators. The field is open to such that in the last few years many creators have become full time content creators. It is only because this field is overwhelming when it comes to the loyal audience that you achieve for your hardwork and then once established you’re handsomely paid for the work you put out there.</p>
		<p>The news in the market is Instagram soon like Youtube would be introducing ads features on Insta Live as well as IGTV videos, it will enable creators to monetise through instagram as well, with 55% of the ad revenue going to the creator (a cut that’s comparable to YouTube).</p>

<div style="padding:20px; font-size:18px;"> <p></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"><p><strong style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"><u>Reasons why you should opt for a poetry writing course?</u></strong></p><p><strong style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Reason 1</strong><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"> : It can help you figure out how you feel. Let’s face it life is confusing! Maybe a friend recently said something rude to you, and you weren’t sure how to respond. Writing down what happened can help you sort out your emotions. Maybe you’re feeling excited, angry, betrayed, nervous or guilty—or perhaps you’re feeling a few of those things at once. Putting words on paper allows you to organize your thoughts.</span></p><p><strong style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Reason 2</strong><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"> : Writing can help you cope. Say you didn’t get into the college of your dreams or your crush just broke your heart. These types of scenarios can be humiliating and overwhelming—and there’s nothing that you can do to go back in time and change the outcome. But writing about how sad or frustrated you’re feeling, you may actually start to perk up. Instead of keeping your emotions bottled up, writing helps you get them out into the open and deal with them. Think of it as a form of therapy that’s totally free.</span></p><p><strong style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Reason 3</strong><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"> : Writing gets the gunk out. Just like flossing removes gunk from between your teeth, writing removes gunk from between your brain cells. So if something is waking you up in the middle of the night, try writing it down. By writing a personal diary or journal, you can release pent up emotions like sadness, anger, or bitterness. You can write happy things down too — For example I try to write down one thing that I’m grateful each day.&nbsp;</span></p><p><strong style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Reason 4 </strong><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">: Writing builds authority, writing a blog about cycling made people think I was an expert. Think about the people you admire in your field: you probably know of their work because they write about it. Writing makes you an expert. Writing unlocks doors too. Instead of asking someone you admire if you can “pick your brains about something over coffee”, you can ask to interview them for your blog. Much better.</span></p><p><strong style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Reason 5 </strong><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">: Writing makes ideas better. By writing down an idea so that someone else can understand it makes it clearer to yourself.</span></p><p><em style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">If you can’t explain it to a six year old, you don’t understand it yourself.” ― Albert Einstein</em></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">The act of writing forces you to get to the core of an idea. If your thinking is muddy, your writing will be too. But if you’ve found a way to write it down clearly, you can be sure that you’re onto something good.</span></p><p></p><br><br><br> </div>

<div style="padding:20px; font-size:18px;"><p>The unfolding of Fables, folklores, mythologies started even before humans could write. Stories were passed on in oral forms from one generation to another before written form was exercised. From <strong>The Shipwrecked Sailor</strong> to Aesop fables to Jatakas, and Panchtantras; the arena of short stories has only evolved. But there are a lot of elements that go into writing a short story. Let's start with the Plot of the short story.

Poetry comes from the greek word <em><strong>poiesis</strong></em>, meaning <em><strong>‘making’</strong></em> or <em><strong>‘creating’</strong></em>.
